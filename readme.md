#mDrawBot ---- Draw Your Own Legend

## Notes for Mac Users

1. Use [Version 1.2.2](http://download.makeblock.com/mdraw/mDraw_V1.2.2_mac.app.zip) - it fixed some issues on firmware update.
2. If you use Mac Os Sierra, update the serial chip driver [following this guide](http://www.mblock.cc/posts/run-makeblock-ch340-ch341-on-mac-os-sierra). Apple changed the way drivers run.


## What is mDrawBot ?

mDrawbot is a four-in-one drawing robotic kit, you can assembly into 4 different configuration drawing robots: **mScara, mCar, mSpide and mEggBot**. This kit consists of Makeblock parts. We designed a powerful software named mDraw to control these robots, it also can control the XY Plotter V2.0 based on Makeblock platform.

This kit consists of over 60 components from Makeblock, including beams, brackets, motor, etc. It also comes with a specially-designed software named mDraw to control these robots. Here's the picture of all the components.

#### **mScara**

mScara is a SCARA （Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm）drive by stepper motor. If you install a pen on mScara, it can draw the pattern on a flat surface. If you install the laser upgrade pack, it can turn into a desktop laser engraver machine.

#### **mSpider**

mSpider is a skilled drawing robot can draw pictures on wall or white boards. Two stepper motors control the movement of mSpider according the rope. In theory, increasing the length of rope it can draw on quite wide wall.

#### **mEggBot**

mEggBot is designed to draw on all kinds of things that are normally impossible to print on, such as eggs or ping-pong balls. You can write letters or draw expression on egess or writing on Easter eggs.

#### **mCar**

mCar is a three-wheel robot car, it contains two stepper motor drive wheels and a ball caster wheel. It can drive its own movements on surface. It can draw on white paper, on the desk. If you install the chalk instead of the pen, it can draw on the floor.

## How to Use mDrawBot? 

Each mDrawBot kit can be assembled into any of the 4 different configurations. We provide the detailed assembling instructions that enables you to build any configuration in an hour. 
The assembly instructions and the user guide can be downloaded here: [http://learn.makeblock.cc/mdrawbot/](http://learn.makeblock.cc/mdrawbot/)

## Software 

mDraw is the software specially designed for mDrawBot. After installing the mDraw software, you can import images that you wish your robot to draw. It is completely compatible with the four forms of mDrawBot and also both the servo mode and laser mode of Makeblock XY Plotter V2.0. 

## Features of mDraw 

 - Support mScara, mSpider, mEggBot, mCar, XY  
 - Support both pen drawing and laser engraving  
 - Support custom settings of motor direction, drawing range, etc  
 - Support saving parameters  
 - Support SVG. file  
 - Support conversion from BMP to SVG  
 - Support zooming, rotating, mirroring, and moving the SVG graphics  
 - Support Windows7 or later. (Will be available in Mac OS X, Linux soon.)  

## About mDrawBot’s upgrade.

You can also design your own upgrade pack for your mDrawBot. By adding an [accelerometer and gyro sensor](http://www.makeblock.cc/me-3-axis-accelerometer-and-gyro-sensor/), it will become a two-wheeled self-balancing vehicle. Add some additional Makeblock mechanical parts and it may be transformed into a [XY plotter](http://www.makeblock.cc/xy-plotter-robot-kit-v2-0-with-electronic/). The only limit is your imagination.

(Note: You need to prepare the parts needed.)
